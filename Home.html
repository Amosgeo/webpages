<strong><em>"From Dr. Amos Abreham MD, Medical Director</em></strong></p>
<p>“I started with a small solo medical practice, a style of practicing 
medicine like my grandfather and great-grandfather did, focusing on the 
patient and applying great attention to detail. As we grow, we are 
maintaining this commitment to quality, ethics and the doctor-patient 
relationship while using the best tools and technology from every 
discipline to achieve optimal results.”</p></blockquote>
